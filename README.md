## Installation

Before getting started, you need to have Python 3.x and PyTorch installed on your machine. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the REINFORCE algorithm implementation, you need to import the `REINFORCE` class from `reinforce.py`:

```python
from reinforce import REINFORCE
```

Then, create an instance of the `REINFORCE` class, passing in the environment, network architecture, learning rate, and other optional parameters as necessary:

\```python
agent = REINFORCE(env, network, learning_rate=0.01)
\```

Finally, train the agent using the `train` method, specifying the number of episodes and other optional parameters:

\```python
agent.train(num_episodes=1000)
\```

## Example

An example usage of this implementation can be found in the `example.py` file, which demonstrates training an agent to solve the CartPole-v0 environment from the OpenAI Gym:

\```bash
python example.py
\```
